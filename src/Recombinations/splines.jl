    parent_coefficients(R::RecombinedBSplineBasis, coefs::AbstractVector)

Returns the coefficients associated to the parent B-spline basis, from the
coefficients `coefs` in the recombined basis.

Note that this function doesn't allocate, since it returns a lazy concatenation
(via LazyArrays.jl) of two StaticArrays and a view of the `coefs` vector.
