    AvgKnots <: SelectionMethod

Each collocation point is chosen as a sliding average over `k - 1` knots:

```math
x_i = \\frac{1}{k - 1} âˆ‘_{j = 1}^{k - 1} t_{i + j}
```

The resulting collocation points are sometimes called Greville sites
(de Boor 2001).

    collocation_points(B::AbstractBSplineBasis; method=Collocation.AvgKnots())

Define and return adapted collocation points for evaluation of splines.

The number of returned collocation points is equal to the number of functions in
the basis.

Note that if `B` is a [`RecombinedBSplineBasis`](@ref) (adapted for boundary value
problems), collocation points are not included at the boundaries, since the
boundary conditions are implicitly satisfied by the basis.

In principle, the choice of collocation points is not unique.
The selection method can be chosen via the `method` argument.
For now, only a single method is accepted:

- [`Collocation.AvgKnots()`](@ref)
