Compute Galerkin mass or stiffness matrix, as well as more general variants
of these.

# Extended help

The Galerkin mass matrix is defined as

```math
M_{ij} = ⟨ ϕ_i, ϕ_j ⟩ \\quad \\text{for} \\quad
i ∈ [1, N] \\text{ and } j ∈ [1, N],
```

where ``ϕ_i(x)`` is the ``i``-th basis function and `N = length(B)` is the
number of functions in the basis `B`.
Here, ``⟨f, g⟩`` is the [``L^2`` inner
product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-integrable_function#Properties)
between functions ``f`` and ``g``.

Since products of B-splines are themselves piecewise polynomials, integrals can
be computed exactly using [Gaussian quadrature
rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature).
To do this, we use Gauss--Legendre quadratures via the
[FastGaussQuadrature](https://github.com/JuliaApproximation/FastGaussQuadrature.jl)
package.

## Matrix layout and types

The mass matrix is banded with ``2k - 1`` bands.
Moreover, the matrix is symmetric and positive definite, and only ``k`` bands are
needed to fully describe the matrix.
Hence, a
[`Hermitian`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/index.html#LinearAlgebra.Hermitian)
view of an underlying matrix is returned.

By default, the underlying matrix holding the data is a `BandedMatrix` that
defines the upper part of the symmetric matrix.
Other types of container are also supported, including regular sparse matrices
(`SparseMatrixCSC`) and dense arrays (`Matrix`).
See [`collocation_matrix`](@ref) for a discussion on matrix types.

## Derivatives of basis functions

Galerkin matrices associated to the derivatives of basis functions may be
constructed using the optional `deriv` parameter.
For instance, if `deriv = (Derivative(0), Derivative(2))`, the matrix
``⟨ ϕ_i, ϕ_j'' ⟩`` is constructed, where primes denote derivatives.
Note that, if the derivative orders are different, the resulting matrix is not
symmetric, and a `Hermitian` view is not returned in those cases.

## Combining different bases

More generally, it is possible to compute matrices of the form
``⟨ ψ_i^{(n)}, ϕ_j^{(m)} ⟩``, where `n` and `m` are derivative orders, and ``ψ_i``
and ``ϕ_j`` belong to two *different* (but related) bases `B₁` and `B₂`.
For this, instead of the `B` parameter, one must pass a tuple of bases
`(B₁, B₂)`.
The restriction is that the bases must have the same parent B-spline basis.
That is, they must share the same set of B-spline knots and be of equal
polynomial order.

Note that, if both bases are different, the matrix will not be symmetric, and
will not even be square if the bases have different lengths.

In practice, this feature may be used to combine a B-spline basis `B`, with a
recombined basis `R` generated from `B` (see [Basis recombination](@ref)).

The matrix may be a `Hermitian` view, in which case only one half of the matrix

More generally, it is possible to combine different functional bases by passing
