It is described for instance in Boyd 2000 (ch. 6), in the context of a Chebyshev basis. In this approach, the original basis, b_i(x) 1  i  N, is \"recombined\" into a new basis, ϕ_j(x) 1  j  M, so that each basis function ϕ_j individually satisfies the chosen BCs.\n\nThe length M of the recombined basis is always smaller than the length N of the original basis. The difference, δ = N - M, is equal to the number of boundary conditions. In the simplest (and most common) case, a single BC is applied on each boundary, leading to δ = 2. More generally, as described further below, it is possible to simultaneously impose different BCs, which further decreases the number of degrees of freedom (increasing δ).\n\nThanks to the local support of B-splines, basis recombination involves only a little portion of the original B-spline basis. For instance, since there is only one B-spline that is non-zero at each boundary, removing that function from the basis is enough to apply homogeneous Dirichlet BCs. Imposing BCs for derivatives is slightly more complex, but still possible.\n\nNote that, when combining basis recombination with collocation methods, there must be no collocation points at the boundaries, or the resulting collocation matrices may not be invertible.\n\nOrder of the boundary condition\n\nIn this section, we consider the simplest case where a single homogeneous boundary condition, mathrmd^n u  mathrmdx^n = 0, is to be satisfied by the basis.\n\nThe recombined basis requires the specification of a Derivative object determining the order of the homogeneous BCs to be applied at the two boundaries. Linear combinations of Derivatives are also supported. The order of the B-spline needs to be k  n + 1, since a B-spline of order k is a C^k - 1-continuous function (except on the knots where it is C^k - 1 - p, with p the knot multiplicity).\n\nSome usual choices are:\n\nDerivative(0) sets homogeneous Dirichlet BCs (u = 0 at the boundaries) by removing the first and last B-splines, i.e. ϕ_1 = b_2;\nDerivative(1) sets homogeneous Neumann BCs (u = 0 at the boundaries) by adding the two first (and two last) B-splines, i.e. ϕ_1 = b_1 + b_2.\nmore generally, α Derivative(0) + β Derivative(1) sets homogeneous Robin BCs by defining ϕ_1 as a linear combination of b_1 and b_2. Here it's important to note that Derivative(1) denotes the normal derivative at the boundary, fracun, which is equal to -fracux on the left boundary.\n\nHigher order BCs are also possible. For instance, Derivative(2) recombines the first three B-splines into two basis functions that satisfy ϕ_1 = ϕ_2 = 0 at the left boundary, while ensuring that lower and higher-order derivatives keep degrees of freedom at the boundary. Note that simply adding the first three B-splines, as in ϕ_1 = b_1 + b_2 + b_3, makes the first derivative vanish as well as the second one, which is unwanted.\n\nFor Derivative(2), the chosen solution is to set ϕ_i = α_i b_i + β_i b_i + 1 for i  1 2. The α_i and β_i coefficients are chosen such that ϕ_i = 0 at the boundary. Moreover, they satisfy the (somewhat arbitrary) constraint α_i + β_i = 2 for each i, for consistency with the Neumann case described above. This generalises to higher order BCs. Note that, since each boundary function ϕ_i is defined from only two neighbouring B-splines, its local support stays minimal, hence preserving the small bandwidth of the resulting matrices.\n\nFinally, note that in the current implementation, it is not possible to impose different boundary conditions on both boundaries.\n\nMultiple boundary conditions\n\nAs an option, the recombined basis may simultaneously satisfy homogeneous BCs of different orders. In this case, a tuple of Derivatives must be passed.\n\nFor more details on the supported combinations of BCs, see the different RecombinedBSplineBasis constructors documented further below.\n\n\n\nRecombinedBSplineBasis(op::AbstractDifferentialOp, B::BSplineBasis)\n\nConstruct RecombinedBSplineBasis from B-spline basis B, satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions associated to the given differential operator.\n\nFor instance, op = Derivative(0) and op = Derivative(1) correspond to homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann BCs, respectively.\n\nLinear combinations of differential operators are also supported. For instance, op = Derivative(0) + λ Derivative(1) corresponds to homogeneous Robin BCs.\n\nHigher-order derivatives are also allowed, being only limited by the order of the B-spline basis.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> B = BSplineBasis(BSplineOrder(4), -1:0.2:1)\n13-element BSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n\njulia> R_neumann = RecombinedBSplineBasis(Derivative(1), B)\n11-element RecombinedBSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n BCs left:  (D{1},)\n BCs right: (D{1},)\n\njulia> R_robin = RecombinedBSplineBasis(Derivative(0) + 3Derivative(1), B)\n11-element RecombinedBSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n BCs left:  (D{0} + 3 * D{1},)\n BCs right: (D{0} + 3 * D{1},)\n\n\n\nRecombinedBSplineBasis(ops, B::BSplineBasis)\n\nConstruct RecombinedBSplineBasis simultaneously satisfying homogeneous BCs associated to multiple differential operators.\n\nCurrently, the following cases are supported:\n\nall derivatives up to order m:\n ops = (Derivative(0), ..., Derivative(m))\nThis boundary condition is obtained by removing the first m + 1 B-splines from the original basis.\nFor instance, if (Derivative(0), Derivative(1)) is passed, then the basis simultaneously satisfies homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann BCs at the two boundaries. The resulting basis is ϕ_1 = b_3 ϕ_2 = b_4  ϕ_N - 4 = b_N - 2.\nan extension of the above, with an additional differential operator of order n at the end:\n ops = (Derivative(0), ..., Derivative(m), D(n))\nThe operator D(n) may be a Derivative, or a linear combination of derivatives. The only restriction is that its maximum degree must satisfy n ≥ m + 1.\nOne example is the combination of homogeneous Dirichlet BCs, u = 0 on the boundaries, with Robin BCs for the derivative, u + λ u = 0, which corresponds to ops = (Derivative(0), Derivative(1) + λ Derivative(2)).\ngeneralised natural boundary conditions:\n ops = Natural()\nThis is equivalent to ops = (Derivative(2), Derivative(3), ..., Derivative(k ÷ 2)) where k is the spline order (which must be even). See Natural for details.\n\nIn the first two cases, the degrees of the differential operators must be in increasing order. For instance, ops = (Derivative(1), Derivative(0)) fails with an error.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> ops = (Derivative(0), Derivative(1));\n\n\njulia> R1 = RecombinedBSplineBasis(ops, B)\n9-element RecombinedBSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n BCs left:  (D{0}, D{1})\n BCs right: (D{0}, D{1})\n\njulia> ops = (Derivative(0), Derivative(1) - 4Derivative(2));\n\n\njulia> R2 = RecombinedBSplineBasis(ops, B)\n9-element RecombinedBSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n BCs left:  (D{0}, D{1} + -4 * D{2})\n BCs right: (D{0}, D{1} + -4 * D{2})\n\njulia> R3 = RecombinedBSplineBasis(Natural(), B)\n11-element RecombinedBSplineBasis of order 4, domain [-1.0, 1.0]\n knots: [-1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -1.0, -0.8, -0.6, -0.4, -0.2, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0]\n BCs left:  (D{2},)\n BCs right: (D{2},)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"recombination/#Base.parent-Tuple{RecombinedBSplineBasis}","page":"Basis recombination","title":"Base.parent","text":"parent(R::RecombinedBSplineBasis)\n\nGet original B-spline basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"recombination/#Base.length-Tuple{RecombinedBSplineBasis}","page":"Basis recombination","title":"Base.length","text":"length(R::RecombinedBSplineBasis)\n\nReturns the number of functions in the recombined basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"recombination/#BSplineKit.Recombinations.constraints","page":"Basis recombination","title":"BSplineKit.Recombinations.constraints","text":"constraints(R::AbstractBSplineBasis) -> (left, right)\nconstraints(A::RecombineMatrix) -> (left, right)\n\nReturn the constraints (homogeneous boundary conditions) that the basis satisfies on each boundary.\n\nConstraints are returned as a tuple (left, right) indicating the BCs that are satisfied on each boundary.

Here, f g is the L^2 inner product between functions f and g.\n\nSince products of B-splines are themselves piecewise polynomials, integrals can be computed exactly using Gaussian quadrature rules. To do this, we use Gauss–Legendre quadratures via the FastGaussQuadrature package.\n\nMatrix layout and types\n\nThe mass matrix is banded with 2k - 1 bands. Moreover, the matrix is symmetric and positive definite, and only k bands are needed to fully describe the matrix. Hence, a Hermitian view of an underlying matrix is returned.\n\nBy default, the underlying matrix holding the data is a BandedMatrix that defines the upper part of the symmetric matrix. Other types of container are also supported, including regular sparse matrices (SparseMatrixCSC) and dense arrays (Matrix). See collocation_matrix for a discussion on matrix types.\n\nnote: Periodic B-spline bases\nThe default matrix type is BandedMatrix, except for periodic bases (PeriodicBSplineBasis), in which case the Galerkin matrix has a few out-of-bands entries due to periodicity. For periodic bases, SparseMatrixCSC is the default. Note that this may change in the future.\n\nDerivatives of basis functions\n\nGalerkin matrices associated to the derivatives of basis functions may be constructed using the optional deriv parameter. For instance, if deriv = (Derivative(0), Derivative(2)), the matrix  ϕ_i ϕ_j  is constructed, where primes denote derivatives. Note that, if the derivative orders are different, the resulting matrix is not symmetric, and a Hermitian view is not returned in those cases.\n\nCombining different bases\n\nMore generally, it is possible to compute matrices of the form  ψ_i^(n) ϕ_j^(m) , where n and m are derivative orders, and ψ_i and ϕ_j belong to two different (but related) bases B₁ and B₂. For this, instead of the B parameter, one must pass a tuple of bases (B₁, B₂). The restriction is that the bases must have the same parent B-spline basis. That is, they must share the same set of B-spline knots and be of equal polynomial order.\n\nNote that, if both bases are different, the matrix will not be symmetric, and will not even be square if the bases have different lengths.\n\nIn practice, this feature may be used to combine a B-spline basis B, with a recombined basis R generated from B (see Basis recombination).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"galerkin/#BSplineKit.Galerkin.galerkin_matrix!","page":"Galerkin tools","title":"BSplineKit.Galerkin.galerkin_matrix!","text":"galerkin_matrix!(A::AbstractMatrix, B::AbstractBSplineBasis,\n                 deriv = (Derivative(0), Derivative(0)))\n\nFill preallocated Galerkin matrix.\n\nThe matrix may be a Hermitian view, in which case only one half of the matrix will be filled.
